    title: The Girl With the Red Umbrella
    description: The girl with the red umbrella. Incredibly, I initially converted this shot to black and white, as I did all my street shots when I first started. It was only later when I saw a shot by Saul Leiter of a girl in the snow with a red umbrella that I went back to it.

    description: A rainy day in London. A simple shot and lends itself nicely to Black and White.

    title: The Temples
    description: The light in the temples can be really dramatic, especially with the vibrant colours and people.

    description: Airports are a great place to take 'street' photos. This one was in Heathrow Terminal 5. I do like a good silhouette!

    title: Low Tide
    description: Low Tide in Saltburn. X marks the spot! great reflections at low tide. The pier is a small player in this shot but does help to identify the location.

    title: Low Tide
    description: Low Tide in Saltburn. I love these extreme letterbox crops for landscapes, especially one that is as simple and calm as this one.

    title: Low Tide
    description: Low Tide in Saltburn. This almost looks like a cosmic spacecraft drifting through the sky. At low tide and in the right weather conditions the bottom of Hunt Cliff in Saltburn can look really 'other worldly'.

    title: Simple Scene
    description: There was an amazing view of the bay outside Kissamos just over the wall. I was just as drawn to this simple scene that presented itself when I sat down at the opposite side of the terrace.

    title: Lower Yosemite Falls
    description: Lower Yosemite Falls. We visited after one of the rainiest spells in recent times, so all the falls were in full flow. This and the fact it was Memorial Weekend in USA made for many crowds. I had to clamber over fences and rocks to get a clear shot, and deal with the constant spray on the lens.

    description: This lady was watching us taking photographs and kept hiding and peeping out from behind the post. It felt to me like it was her 'safe space' with Bruce Lee also backing her up!

    title: Sad Clown
    description: Clowns can often look sad. This one's demeanour and lack of interest from passers by just amplified that feeling.

    title: Fancy Dress
    description: I don't know whether these guys were on their way to a fancy dress party or just dress like this but walking past the Christian bookshop was too good an opportunity to miss. My only disappointment is that the figure at the back was a little too close to the rest of the group to stand out.
